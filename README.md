# Scheduling and page replacement algorithms
simulation of these algorithms was done for myuni project and was used for comparison between them. 
Thats also why both categories of algorithms have included generator.py, so that they can be also tested on big and random set of variables

## Scheduling algorithms
- FCFS - First Come First Serve
- RR - Round Robin
- SJF - Shortest Job First

## Page replacement algorithms
- FIFO - First In First Out
- LRU - Least Recently Used
- RR - Random Replacment
- OPT - Optimal
